# Complete Netlify Deployment Guide

## Files Created for You:

✅ `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration  
✅ `netlify/functions/products.js` - Products API  
✅ `netlify/functions/products-featured.js` - Featured products API  

## Step-by-Step Deployment:

### 1. Download Files from Replit
Download these files to your local project:
- `netlify.toml` (put in root directory)
- `netlify/functions/products.js` 
- `netlify/functions/products-featured.js`

### 2. Copy Product Images
Copy all `.jpg` and `.webp` files from Replit's `attached_assets/` folder to your local project's `client/public/assets/` folder.

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Netlify deployment configuration"
git push
```

### 4. Deploy on Netlify
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Choose your `khaista-boutique-export` repository
5. **Build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### 5. Custom Domain (Optional)
Once deployed, you can add a custom domain in Netlify settings.

## Why This Will Work:

✅ **Netlify Functions** handle your API endpoints  
✅ **Static assets** serve your images  
✅ **SPA redirects** handle React routing  
✅ **No serverless issues** like Vercel had  

Your site will be live within 2-3 minutes of deployment!
